Student Name: Mrwan Alhandi
Student ID: 3969393
Highest level attempted: Till part 2 from HD
Submission History: None

Explaination of the code: I was restricted in time to do this project. I assumed that if I didnt do a UML/ER diagram and started the assignment right away, I will save time. When I reached the requirements of distinction level, I started to have trouble identifying the relationships between the classes and the multiplicity. The approach I took was simply I read the whole level part and then I wrote the code.

Problems with my code and requirements that I have not met: I have done till part 2 of HD level. Due to restricted time, I assumed some of the requirements in a specific way. Otherwise, I would have asked specifically the meaning of some of the requirements. For example, I assumed that the program will end if either file customers.txt or products.txt does not exist and not both.
